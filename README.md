# Pokemon-Trading-Cards

This repository is a project that aims to scrape all single Pokemon cards for sale on Chaoscards.co.uk.

I have created a scraper named, pokemon_card_scraper.py.

This will use Selenium to scrape all data on all pages containing single cards sorted by the highest value cards first to the lowest value cards.

Once the data has been collected it will be structured and cleaned then saved to a CSV file.

I have included a simple analysis of how average reverse holo card prices compare against standard card of the same pokemon and generation.

I have completed the analysis with data created from an SQL query using the CSV file and also using Python to verify the results.
