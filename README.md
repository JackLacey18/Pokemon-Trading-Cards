# Pokemon-Trading-Cards

This repository is a project that aims to scrape all single Pokemon cards for sale on Chaoscards.co.uk.

I have created a scraper named, pokemon_card_scraper.py.

This will use Selenium to scrape all data on all pages containing single cards sorted by the highest value cards first to the lowest value cards.

Once the data has been collected it will be structured and cleaned then saved to a CSV file.
